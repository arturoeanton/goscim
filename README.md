## 🌟 Features That Make Developers Happy

### 🏗️ **Dynamic Schema System**
No code changes needed - just drop JSON schemas and restart:

```json
{
  "id": "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:custom:2.0:Employee",
  "name": "Employee",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "name": "employeeId",
      "type": "string",
      "required": true,
      "uniqueness": "server"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 🔍 **Powerful Query Engine**
Advanced filtering with natural syntax:

```http
GET /Users?filter=name.familyName co "Garcia" and active eq true
GET /Users?filter=emails[type eq "work" and value ew "@company.com"]
```

### 🔌 **Easy Integrations**
Connect to any system with our flexible connector architecture:

```go
// Custom connector in just a few lines
func (c *CustomConnector) SyncUsers() error {
    users := c.externalSystem.GetUsers()
    for _, user := range users {
        scimUser := convertToSCIM(user)
        c.scimClient.CreateOrUpdateUser(scimUser)
    }
    return nil
}
```

## 🛠️ Real-World Examples

### Create a User
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-scim-server.com/scim/v2/Users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],
    "userName": "jane.doe@company.com",
    "name": {
      "familyName": "Doe",
      "givenName": "Jane"
    },
    "emails": [{
      "value": "jane.doe@company.com",
      "type": "work",
      "primary": true
    }],
    "active": true
  }'
```

### Search with Filters
```bash
curl "https://your-scim-server.com/scim/v2/Users?filter=userName sw 'admin'&sortBy=name.familyName"
```

### Update User
```bash
curl -X PATCH https://your-scim-server.com/scim/v2/Users/123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
    "Operations": [{
      "op": "replace",
      "path": "active",
      "value": false
    }]
  }'
```
